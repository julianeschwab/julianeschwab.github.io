        <h2>About me</h2>

                
                <p>My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a cognitive scientist spezialized in theoretical and psycholinguistics. I work as 
                terminologist and software product manager at the translation and language service provider oneword GmbH (Böblingen, Germany).</p>

                <p>I have previous experience as lab manager at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (Tübingen, Germany) and as post-doctoral researcher 
                        at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen. <br> My PhD in Cognitive Science
                        was supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller 
                        (University of Vienna). In my dissertation, I investigated the semantics, pragmatics, and processing of polarity items 
                        using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods.</p>

                <p>While I have left academia, but you can continue to find records (publications, talks, teaching materials) of my contributions to the field here. </p>
