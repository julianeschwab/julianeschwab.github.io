        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p> My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the <b>Department of Linguistics</b> at the <b>University of T체bingen</b>.       
                I completed my PhD in 2022 at the Institute of Cognitive Science in Osnabr체ck, Germany. My supervisors were Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller (University of Vienna).
          In my dissertation, I investigated the semantics, pragmatics, and processing of polarity items using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods. 
          </p>  
                        
        <p>In my research, I aim for an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistics, and Bayesian statistical modelling to 
                elucidate how natural language is used and processed, 
                and to characterize language from a dynamic interactive perspective between speaker(s), listener(s) and context in a wide sense. </p>
        <p>I am broadly interested in the semantics/pragmatics interface, probabilistic pragmatic modelling, and cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 
                </p>
        
        <h3>News:</h3>
<p> [Sep 2022] I am happy to announce that I will be joining the Department of Linguistics at the University of T체bingen from October 2022.
