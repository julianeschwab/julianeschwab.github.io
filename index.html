        <h2>About me</h2>

                
                <p>My name is Juliane Schwab, I am currently working as research operations managing assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics
                        in Tübingen (Germany).</p>

                <p>I have previously worked as post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen and hold a PhD in Cognitive Science
                        (Osnabrück University, Germany), which was supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller 
                        (University of Vienna). In my dissertation, I investigated the semantics, pragmatics, and processing of polarity items 
                        using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods.</p>

                <p>I no longer actively contribute to linguistic research, but you can continue to find records (publications, talks, teaching materials) of my work here. 
                My research focused on the semantics/pragmatics interface, probabilistic pragmatic modelling, and cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 
                I aimed for an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistics, and Bayesian statistical 
                modelling to elucidate how natural language is used and processed, and to characterize language from a dynamic interactive perspective between speaker(s), 
                listener(s) and context in a wide sense. </p>
