        <h2>About me</h2>

                
                <p>My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a cognitive scientist spezialized in theoretical and psycholinguistics. I work as 
                manager of the software suite of the translation and language service provider oneword GmbH (Böblingen, Germany).</p>

                <p>I have previously worked as a lab manager at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (Tübingen, Germany) and as post-doctoral researcher 
                        at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Tübingen. <br> I hold a PhD in Cognitive Science
                        (Osnabrück University, Germany), which was supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller 
                        (University of Vienna). In my dissertation, I investigated the semantics, pragmatics, and processing of polarity items 
                        using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods.</p>

                <p>I no longer work as a (psycho-)linguistics scientist, but you can continue to find records (publications, talks, teaching materials) of my contributions to the field here. 
                My research focused on the semantics/pragmatics interface, probabilistic pragmatic modelling, and cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 
                I aimed for an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistics, and Bayesian statistical 
                modelling to elucidate how natural language is used and processed, and to characterize language from a dynamic interactive perspective between speaker(s), 
                listener(s) and context in a wide sense. </p>
